ResearchX's web research tools retrieve current information and source text during research workflows. They support multiple simultaneous queries, simultaneous all-provider search, explicit proxy routing, domain and recency filtering, bounded GitHub issue and pull-request documents, provider-available page-text retrieval, raw or question-grounded page retrieval, direct images, and passage lookup inside stored page content. The researcher agent uses them alongside AlphaXiv to gather evidence from non-academic sources like blog posts, documentation, news, and code repositories.

## Routing modes

The bundled `pi-web-access` package can choose one provider, follow a configured fallback route, or query every eligible provider simultaneously:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Follow the available-provider fallback route |
| `all` | Query every eligible provider except explicit-only DuckDuckGo, Kimi, AnySearch, xAI, Bright Data, and SerpBase; preserve partial successes and deduplicate sources |
| `duckduckgo` | Force keyless DuckDuckGo HTML search; also available inside an explicit fallback route |
| `tinyfish` | Force TinyFish Search; also enables TinyFish Fetch as a hosted extraction fallback |
| `kagi` | Force Kagi Search; also enables Kagi Extract as a hosted extraction fallback |
| `bocha` | Force Bocha Search; accepts `bochaApiKey` or `BOCHA_API_KEY` |
| `ollama` | Force Ollama Cloud Web Search; also enables Ollama Web Fetch as an extraction fallback |
| `perplexity` | Force Perplexity Sonar for all web searches |
| `exa` | Force Exa for all web searches |
| `gemini` | Force Gemini API grounding |
| `kimi` | Explicit-only Kimi Code Plan search using Pi's `kimi-coding` login |
| `jina` | Force Jina Search; can return provider-fetched page Markdown with results |
| `xai` | Explicit-only xAI/Grok hosted search |
| `brightdata` | Explicit-only Bright Data SERP search; requires a SERP zone |
| `serpbase` | Explicit-only SerpBase Google SERP search |

## Default behavior

The default path does not read Chromium or Chrome cookies and does not request macOS Keychain access. With no explicit provider or custom `searchRouting`, `auto` tries configured SearXNG first. When the active model uses `openai-codex`, Codex-backed OpenAI search comes next; otherwise Exa comes before OpenAI. Brave, Parallel, TinyFish, Search1API, Searchinfinity, Querit, Tavily, Jina, SERPdive, Kagi, Bocha, Ollama, Perplexity, and Gemini remain later fallbacks.

Configure an explicit API key for Exa, Perplexity, TinyFish, Jina, or Gemini in `~/.researchx/web-search.json` before running source-heavy workflows like `/deepresearch`. Exa's zero-config MCP fallback remains available without a key.

## Configuration

Check the current search configuration:

```bash
researchx search status
```

Edit `~/.researchx/web-search.json` to configure the backend:

```json
{
  "provider": "auto",
  "searchProvider": "auto",
  "exaApiKey": "exa_...",
  "perplexityApiKey": "pplx-...",
  "tinyfishApiKey": "sk-tinyfish-...",
  "jinaApiKey": "jina_...",
  "geminiAuth": "adc",
  "geminiProject": "research-project",
  "geminiLocation": "us-central1",
  "proxy": "http://proxy.example:8080",
  "allowBrowserCookies": false,
  "browserCookies": {
    "browser": "chrome",
    "profile": "Default"
  },
  "datalabApiKey": "$DATALAB_API_KEY",
  "kagiApiKey": "kagi-...",
  "bochaApiKey": "sk-bocha-...",
  "ollamaApiKey": "ollama-...",
  "openaiSearchProviders": ["openai-codex", "openai"],
  "maxInlineContentChars": 30000,
  "pdf": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "auto",
    "maxPages": 100,
    "datalabMode": "balanced",
    "datalabTimeoutMs": 120000
  },
  "summaryGenerationDeadlineMs": 30000,
  "tools": {
    "webSearch": { "enabled": true },
    "sourceCheck": { "enabled": true },
    "fetchContent": { "enabled": true },
    "getSearchContent": { "enabled": true }
  },
  "commands": {
    "websearch": { "enabled": true },
    "curator": { "enabled": true },
    "web-results": { "enabled": true },
    "google-account": { "enabled": true }
  },
  "image": { "enabled": true }
}
```

Set `provider` and `searchProvider` to `all` to query every eligible provider concurrently, or to a specific `pi-web-access` provider such as `tinyfish`, `jina`, `kagi`, `bocha`, `ollama`, `exa`, `perplexity`, or `gemini`. `searchRouting` instead defines an ordered fallback route; `all` is not valid inside that sequential list. DuckDuckGo, Kimi, AnySearch, xAI, Bright Data, and SerpBase must be selected explicitly and do not participate in `all`. Kimi requires Pi's `/login kimi-coding` flow. The `researchx search set <provider> [api-key]` convenience command supports `auto`, `exa`, `perplexity`, and `gemini`; edit the JSON directly for the broader upstream provider set. Jina also accepts `JINA_API_KEY`, supports domain and recency constraints, and can return inline page content.

DuckDuckGo is keyless but explicit-only. Select `"duckduckgo"` directly, or add it to `searchRouting.providers`. It does not run in `auto` or `all`.

For PDF links, `pdf.provider: "auto"` tries Datalab when `DATALAB_API_KEY` or `datalabApiKey` is available, then Gemini, then local PDF.js extraction. Set `pdf.provider` to `"datalab"`, `"gemini"`, or `"unpdf"` to select one tier. `pdf.maxPages` bounds all three tiers and defaults to `100`. Datalab is an optional hosted service; the no-key local path remains available.

Self-hosted SearXNG can use `searxngHeaders` for reverse-proxy or Zero Trust authentication. Bright Data search requires `brightdataSerpZone`; its optional Web Unlocker extraction fallback uses a separate `brightdataUnlockerZone`.

Set `firecrawlBaseUrl` or `FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL` for self-hosted Firecrawl. The configured API may use `localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, or `::1`. Loopback redirects must stay on that configured API origin. Submitted fetch and search targets still reject loopback addresses.

Set top-level `proxy`, or pass the `proxy` parameter to `web_search`, `source_check`, or `fetch_content`, to route that research call through an explicit HTTP(S) proxy. The same per-call proxy decision is passed to GitHub CLI and repository-clone subprocesses. Proxy credentials, request headers, and target URLs are sent to curl through stdin rather than process arguments. `localhost` (including a trailing dot and subdomains), IPv4 `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, IPv4-mapped loopback, and matching `NO_PROXY` domains bypass the proxy. A port-qualified `NO_PROXY` entry applies only to that port, and an empty per-call value forces direct access.

To route OpenAI `web_search` and `source_check` calls through a third-party gateway, set `openaiResponsesUrl` to the gateway's full Responses-compatible endpoint. The default remains OpenAI's official Responses endpoint. `openaiSearchProviders` sets the ordered Pi provider IDs considered for credentials and models; it defaults to `["openai-codex", "openai"]`.

Gemini Web browser-cookie access is disabled by default. To opt in, set `"allowBrowserCookies": true` and optionally choose a supported `browserCookies.browser` plus profile directory name; arbitrary profile paths are rejected. The older `"geminiBrowser": true` alias remains accepted during migration. On macOS, browser access can trigger a Keychain prompt. On Windows, the opt-in path can read Chrome or Edge `v10` cookies through current-user DPAPI. Chromium `v20` app-bound cookies are unsupported and fail closed.

For Vertex-backed Gemini generate-content calls, set `"geminiAuth": "adc"` with `geminiProject` and `geminiLocation`, then provide Google Application Default Credentials through the standard gcloud file (`$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` on macOS/Linux or `%APPDATA%\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json` on Windows) or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. ADC and API-key mode are mutually exclusive: omit `geminiApiKey` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` when selecting ADC. YouTube and local video analysis require API-key mode instead.

Set `enabled` to `false` for one `tools` or `commands` entry to skip that registration after restart. `webSearch.enabled: false` remains a legacy shorthand for disabling `web_search` and `source_check` when no tool-specific override exists. ResearchX uses the `web-results` command key because `/search` belongs to research-session search. Set `image.enabled: false` to block direct images, video frames, and thumbnails. Set `pdf.enabled: false` to block PDF extraction.

`summaryGenerationDeadlineMs` limits one curator or auto-summary model attempt. It defaults to 30,000 ms, accepts positive integers, and caps values at 600,000 ms.

`maxInlineContentChars` sets the default and maximum text slice returned by `fetch_content` and `get_search_content`. It defaults to 30,000 characters and caps values at 200,000.

## Search features

The web search tool supports several capabilities that the researcher agent leverages automatically:

- **Multiple queries** -- Send 2-4 varied-angle queries simultaneously for broader coverage of a topic
- **Domain filtering** -- Restrict results to specific domains like `arxiv.org`, `github.com`, or `nature.com`
- **Recency filtering** -- Filter results by date, useful for fast-moving topics where only recent work matters
- **Page text retrieval** -- Fetch provider-available page text for the most important results rather than relying only on snippets
- **GitHub issue and PR documents** -- Fetch bounded metadata, comments, checks, files, commits, and review threads with anchors and escalation commands
- **Extraction fallback** -- Use Defuddle after ordinary Readability and React Server Component extraction cannot recover useful HTML content
- **Raw HTTP text** -- Use `fetch_content` with `mode: "raw"` to inspect textual API responses, error pages, or other source bytes without article extraction
- **Bounded readable text** -- Readable extraction replaces inline `data:` URI payloads with explicit omission markers before model or cache storage; raw mode preserves the exact textual body
- **Page-grounded answers** -- Use `fetch_content` with `mode: "answer"` and a question to answer against one page while retaining the original page text for inspection
- **Direct images** -- Retrieve PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF links as safely bounded inline images
- **Passage lookup** -- Use `get_search_content` with `findText` and exact, case-insensitive, or fuzzy `findMode` matching to locate a passage in stored content without paging through the entire page
- **Clean continuation** -- Every single-page fetch reports its stored response ID, and long pages also report character, byte, line, and next-offset details

Fetched page bodies live for one hour in `~/.researchx/web-search-cache/`, beside `web-search.json`. The cache keeps at most 128 entries and 128 MiB, evicting the oldest entries first. On macOS and Linux, ResearchX keeps its directory at mode `0700` and files at `0600`. Session JSONL stores only bounded URL metadata and a private cache reference. Custom `RESEARCHX_WEB_SEARCH_CONFIG` paths move the cache beside that exact file.

For `get_search_content`, `offset` and `limit` are ignored when `findText` is supplied, which keeps bridge-injected pagination defaults from blocking passage lookup. `findMode` requires `findText`. Use one of `url`, `urlIndex`, `query`, or `queryIndex` to select stored content when the response contains multiple items.

## When it runs

Web search is used automatically by researcher agents during workflows. You do not need to invoke it directly. The researcher decides when to use web search versus paper search based on the topic and source availability. Academic topics lean toward AlphaXiv; engineering and applied topics lean toward web search.
